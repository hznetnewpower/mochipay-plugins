# Install and use

Download: https://mochi.bz/Downloads/MochiPay_AI_Integration_Skill_1.1.2.zip
Guide: https://mochi.bz/GuideSkill.aspx

ZIP contains one integrate-mochipay folder with SKILL.md, references, assets and an optional Python helper. It does not install a gateway, open an account or grant store/API access.

## Claude

Enable code execution/file creation if the account/workspace permits. Open Customize > Skills > + > Create skill > Upload a skill, upload the complete ZIP and enable it. Ask: "Use MochiPay Integration to connect my store." A conversation attachment is not persistent installation.

## Other assistants

Follow the client's documented Agent Skills support: https://agentskills.io/specification. Generic chatbots and ordinary ChatGPT conversations do not necessarily install skill ZIPs. File/network/script tools and account features vary. No MCP server is bundled. Python3 is optional for offline checks; guidance works without it.

Free under the included MIT license; MochiPay service subscriptions and AI-tool charges/features are separate. Merchant authorization/private configuration are required for store/API actions. No third-party marketplace listing is claimed.
